# GI-NotesApp

Practicing more node.js by creating a notes app and coding along with the udemy NODE videos

This is a notes app that allows users to add, remove, read, and list all your notes. You can add any title and body to your notes app. If you want to add a new note, it will check if the title already exists and notifies you if it does. You can remove any note and notifies you when successful. You can list all the notes that you currently have. If the title doesn't exist, it will notify you that the note doesn't exist.
